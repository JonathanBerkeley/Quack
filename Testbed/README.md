# Testbed
This solution is used for rapidly prototyping and testing possible new features for Quack anti-cheat.    

Expect any code in here to be rough, potentially buggy, not production worthy, and poorly documented.    
It is included in Git tracking purely to track the evolution of new features in Quack.
